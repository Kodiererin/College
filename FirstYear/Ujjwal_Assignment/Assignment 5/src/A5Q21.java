//Write a java program GCD that finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers using 
//Euclid’s algorithm, which is an iterative computation based on the following observation: if x is 
//greater than y, then if y divides x, the gcd of x and y is y; otherwise, the gcd of x and y is the 
//same as the gcd of x % y and y
